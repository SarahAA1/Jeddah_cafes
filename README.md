# Choosing Cafe Location in London
By: Sarah Alharbi 

This repository, is the Capstone projectt as a part of Immersive Data Science Course provided by [MISK](https://hub.misk.org.sa).

In this Project, I'm trying to perform multiple analysis in order to choose the most appropriate location for opening a new Cafe in London.



##  Introduction
London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, in terms of both area and population. According to [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/londons-population), London population in 2020 reached more than 9 Million. It the most populous city in Europe, it ranks 25th populous urban agglomeration of the world and total area is 1580 km². London has become the international financial centre for Europe and is one of three world financial cities alongside New York and Tokyo.


Therefore, I have chosen London to be my scope for this project due to the data availability and also for the great memories I had there, as well as the diverse culture of London.

### Problem Description

The restaurant's location is crucial since the more populous the area is, the more cutomers will visit. However, It should avoid establishing a cafe in a wrong location or in an area with a large number of competitors. That's way opening a new cafe could be a challinging task, because of that investors may have to think carefully about what would be the right place for their coffee shop? We could use machine learning algorithms to know more about what are the best five London neighborhoods for a new café.


### Data Sources


We will be scraping information from Wikipedia that provides data of London Boroughs for this project. Then, we will use the Forsquare API to search for Cafe all around London. Furthermore, while property prices may be an important predictor of how costly the area is, we can also look at AirBnB listings and pricing as an indicator of how expensive the area is.
